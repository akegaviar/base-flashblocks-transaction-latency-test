# Transaction latency testing tool

A Go-based tool for testing and comparing transaction latency performance between different [Flashblocks-enabled Base node](https://blog.base.dev/accelerating-base-with-flashblocks) endpoints.

Flashblocks are sub-blocks issued by the block builder every 200ms, allowing for early confirmation times and making Base 10x faster for real-time applications.

## Requirements

### Node compatibility

For **synchronous** transaction sending testing, the node endpoints must support the `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` RPC method. See [EIP-7966: eth_sendRawTransactionSync Method](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7966).

For **asynchronous** transaction sending testing, the node endpoints do not have to support the `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` RPC method and will rely on separate polling for confirmed transactions.

[Chainstack Base nodes](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-base/) for Mainnet & Testnet support both the synchronous one with `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` and the asynchronous one.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
TO_ADDRESS=0xc2F695613de0885dA3bdd18E8c317B9fAf7d4eba

# If you are going with the asynchronous method and poll for the transaction receipts separately
POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=100

BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_1=https://your-node-endpoint-1.com
BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_2=https://your-node-endpoint-2.com

# This a simple label for the resulting filename to remember where you sent the test transactions from. Not used in any node routing.
REGION=singapore
NUMBER_OF_TRANSACTIONS=10

# With `true`, the synchronous eth_sendRawTransactionSync method is used. With `false`, the asynchronous method is used with POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=100
SEND_TXN_SYNC=true

RUN_ENDPOINT2_TESTING=true
```

### Configuration options

#### Transaction sending testing modes

**`SEND_TXN_SYNC=true`**: 
- Uses `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` method
- Provides instant confirmation receipt when transaction is included in a Flashblock
- Transactions wait for immediate inclusion confirmation

**`SEND_TXN_SYNC=false`**: 
- Uses standard `eth_sendTransaction` method
- Polls for transaction receipts using `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`
- Traditional async transaction sending

#### Polling configuration

**`POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`**: 
- Used only when `SEND_TXN_SYNC=false`
- Defines how frequently (in milliseconds) to check for transaction receipts
- Default: 100ms
- Lower values = more frequent polling = faster detection but higher load
- Not used when `SEND_TXN_SYNC=true` since confirmations are immediate

#### Endpoint testing

**`BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_1`**: Primary endpoint (e.g., a Flashblocks-enabled)
**`BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_2`**: Secondary endpoint (e.g., a standard non-Flashblocks endpoint)

The tool will:
1. Send transactions to `BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_1` first
2. Then send transactions to `BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_2` (if `RUN_ENDPOINT2_TESTING=true`)
3. Compare performance between both endpoints

## Usage

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t transaction-latency .

# Run the test
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data --env-file .env --rm -it transaction-latency
```

## Results

After completion, results are saved to the `./data/` directory:

- `endpoint1-{region}.csv`: Results from `BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_1`
- `endpoint2-{region}.csv`: Results from `BASE_NODE_ENDPOINT_2` (if enabled)

### CSV Format

Each CSV contains:
- `sent_at`: Timestamp when transaction was sent
- `txn_hash`: Transaction hash
- `included_in_block`: Block number where transaction was included
- `inclusion_delay_ms`: Time from sending to confirmation (milliseconds)

## Performance expectations

Flashblocks are produced at 200ms intervals, but actual confirmation times will be higher due to network latency:

- **Standard endpoint**: ~2000ms (2-second block time)
- **Flashblocks endpoint**: ~300-500ms (200ms Flashblock interval + network travel time)

The actual confirmation time depends on:
- Network latency to/from the Base node
- Transaction processing time
- Time until next Flashblock (up to 200ms)
- Network travel time for confirmation response
